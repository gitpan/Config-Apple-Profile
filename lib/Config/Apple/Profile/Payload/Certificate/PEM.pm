=head1 NAME

Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::Certificate::PEM - Certificate payload with
a PEM-format certificate.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Config::Apple::Profile;
    use Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::Certificate::PEM;
    
    my $cert = new Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::Certificate::PEM;
    $cert->payload->{PayloadIdentifier} = 'local.acme.CAcert';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadDisplayName} = 'AcmeCorp internal CA';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadDescription} = 'The certificate authority used for internal web sites.';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadOrganization} = 'Acme, Inc.';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadCertificateFileName} = 'acme.crt'; 
    $cert->payload->{PayloadContent} = '.................'; # Long string here
    
    my $profile = new Config::Apple::Profile;
    push @{$profile->content}, $cert;
    
    print $profile->export;
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements the PEM type of Certificate payload.

This payload contains a single certificate, in a PKCS#1 container,
PEM-encoded.  If you have a file that has "BEGIN CERTIFICATE"
in it, you've probably got this type of certificate.

This payload is used to hold B<only one> certificate.  If you have multiple
certificates, use multiple payloads.


=head1 PAYLOAD KEYS

All of the payload keys defined in 
L<Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::Common::Certificate> are used by this
payload.

This payload has the following additional keys:

=head2 C<PayloadType>

This is fixed to the string C<com.apple.security.pem>.

=head2 C<PayloadVersion>

This is fixed to the value C<1>.
