=head1 NAME

Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::Certificate::Root - Certificate payload with
a DER-format certificate.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Config::Apple::Profile;
    use Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::Certificate::Root;
    
    my $cert = new Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::Certificate::Root;
    $cert->payload->{PayloadIdentifier} = 'local.acme.CAcert';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadDisplayName} = 'AcmeCorp internal CA';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadDescription} = 'The certificate authority used for internal web sites.';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadOrganization} = 'Acme, Inc.';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadCertificateFileName} = 'acme.crt'; 
    $cert->payload->{PayloadContent} = '.............'; # Long binary data here
    
    my $profile = new Config::Apple::Profile::Profile;
    push @{$profile->content}, $cert;
    
    print $profile->export;
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements the root type of Certificate payload.

This payload contains a single certificate, in a PKCS#1 container,
DER-encoded.  For reference, pretty much any certificate you get, when you are
just getting a certificate, will be in a PKCS#1 container.  DER encoding is a
binary encoding, it's not the "BEGIN CERTIFICATE" type of encoding (that's PEM).

This payload is used to hold B<only one> certificate.  If you have multiple
certificates, use multiple payloads.

B<NOTE:>  This type is exactly the same as the C<pkcs1> type of Certificate
payload.


=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

The following instance methods are provided, or overridden, by this class.

=head2 validate_key($key, $value)

Performs additional validation for a certain payload key in this class:

=over 4

=item * C<PayloadContent>

This must be a DER-format certificate that OpenSSL can recognize.

All other payload keys will be checked as usual by the parent class.

=back

See also the documentation in L<Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::Common>.

sub validate_key {
    my ($self, $key, $value) = @_;

    # First, let the parent do validation
    my $parent_validation = $self->SUPER::validate_key($key, $value);
    return $parent_validation if !defined($parent_validation);
    
    # Next, if we are setting payload content, and we can check it, do so!
    if ($key eq 'PayloadContent') {
        return $self->SUPER::validate_cert($value, 'DER');
    }
    
    # For all other keys, return what the parent validated
    else {
        return $parent_validation;
    }
}


=head1 PAYLOAD KEYS

All of the payload keys defined in 
L<Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::Common::Certificate> are used by this
payload.

This payload has the following additional keys:

=head2 C<PayloadType>

This is fixed to the string C<com.apple.security.root>.

=head2 C<PayloadVersion>

This is fixed to the value C<1>.
